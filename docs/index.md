**Current version of the API**: `v1`

## About

The o2r web API acts as the interface between the [o2r](https://o2r.info) [microservices](https://o2r.info/architecture/) and the [web interface](https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-platform).

The API provides services around the executable research compendium (ERC), or "compendium" for short, which is documented **[in the ERC spec](https://o2r.info/erc-spec)**.

**A good starting point for understanding the different parts of the API is the [compendium life-cycle](compendium/overview.md).**

## General notes

The API is implemented as a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful API. The entrypoint for the current version is `/api/v1`.

Unless specified otherwise, responses are always in JSON format.
Body parameters in `POST` requests are expected in `multipart/form-data` format.
Requests to the API should always be made with a secure connection using `HTTPS`.
Some requests require [authentication](user/auth.md) with a specific [user level](user/levels.md).
