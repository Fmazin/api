# Zenodo - WORK IN PROGRESS

Upload an unvalidated research compendium by submitting a link to a Zenodo record (https://www.zenodo.org).

The upload is only allowed for logged in users. To run the upload from the command line, login on the website and open you browser cookies. Find a cookie issued by `o2r.uni-muenster.de` with the name `connect.sid`. Copy the contents of the cookie into the request example below.

Upon successful download from the zenodo record, the `id` for the new compendium is returned.
