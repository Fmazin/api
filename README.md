# o2r Web API

_Please note: this document is still a very rough draft and will change a lot._

## Build

This specification is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can use `mkdocs` to render it locally, or view the latest master-branch on <http://o2r.info/o2r-web-api/>.

### Automated Builds

The current master branch is automatically built on Travis CI and deployed to the GitHub Page at <http://o2r.info/o2r-web-api/>. Our combination of the `.travis.yml` and `.deploy.sh` will run the `mkdocs` command on every direct commit or merge on the master branch and deploy the rendered HTML documents to the `gh-pages` branch in this repository.
