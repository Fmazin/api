For every endpoint that needs user authentication, a cookie with an authenticated session is required.\n\n\nAccess authentication information for direct API access\n\n\nTo run commands which require authentication from the command line, a user must login on the website first. Then open you browser cookies and find a cookie issued by \no2r.uni-muenster.de\n with the name \nconnect.sid\n. Use the the contents of the cookie for your requests, for example as shown below when using curl.\n\n\ncurl [...] --cookie \"connect.sid=<code string here>\" \\\n     http://\u2026/api/v1/endpoint\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication within microservices\n\n\nAttention:\n The authentication process \nrequires\n a secured connection, i.e. \nHTTPS\n.\n\n\nAuthentication provider\n\n\nSession authentication is done using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Currently \nORCID\n is the only available authentication provider, therefore users need to be registered with ORCID. Because of its nature, the authentication workflow is not a RESTful service. Users will need to navigate to the login endpoint with their webbrowser and grant access to the o2r platform for their ORCID account. They will then be sent back to our authentication service, which verifies the authentification request and enriches the user session with the verified ORCID for this user.\n\n\nStart OAuth login\n\n\nNavigate the webbrowser (e.g. via a HTML \n<a>\n link) to \n/api/v1/auth/login\n, which will then redirect the user and request access to your ORCID profile. After granting access, ORCID will redirect the user back to the \n/api/v1/auth/login\n endpoint with a unique \ncode\n param that is used to verify the request.\n\n\nIf the verification was successful, the endpoint returns a session cookie named \nconnect.sid\n, which is tied to a authenticated session. The server answers with a \n301 redirect\n, which redirects the user back to \n/\n, where the o2r platform webinterface resides.\n\n\nIf the login is unsuccessful, the user is not redirected back to the site and no further redirects are configured.\n\n\nRequest authentication status\n\n\nAs the cookie is present in both authenticated and unauthenticated sessions, clients (e.g. webbrowsers) will need to know if their session is authenticated, and if so, as which ORCID user. For this, send a \nGET\n request to the \n/api/v1/auth/whoami\n endpoint, including your session cookie.\n\n\ncurl https://\u2026/api/v1/auth/whoami --cookie \"connect.sid=\u2026\n\n\nGET /api/v1/auth/whoami\n\n\n200 OK\n\n{\n  \"orcid\": \"0000-0001-6021-1617\",\n  \"name\": \"o2r\"\n}\n\n\n\n\nError response for requests requiring authentication\n\n\nWhen no session cookie was included, or the included session cookie does not belong to a authenticated session, the service will respond with a \n401 Unauthorized\n message.\n\n\n401 Unauthorized\n\n{\n  \"error\": \"not authenticated\"\n}\n\n\n\n\nEdit user\n\n\nYou can update information of an existing user using the \nHTTP\n operation \nPATCH\n.\n\n\nRequest for user level change\n\n\nThe request must be made by an authenticated user with an appropriate level.
